# Air Crashes Analysis (1908–2023)

## project Overview

This project analyzes global air crash data from 1908 to 2023 to identify historical trends, high-risk years, aircraft patterns, geographical distribution, and the relationship between crash frequency and fatalities.

The goal is to uncover insights that contribute to aviation safety awareness using data analysis and visualization techniques.
